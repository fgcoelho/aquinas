## The Problem

Inversion of Control (IoC) is great, really great. 

Unfortunately, IoC likes OOP, and OOP likes classes, and classes likes decorators, and decorators are still in proposal for Javascript.

Most times this isn't a big deal, you just go with Typescript, install `reflect-metadata` and drop some configs under `tsconfig.json`.

But what if we could just ignore the use of decorators, classes and reflect-metadata?

Moreover, what if we could do it in plain Javascript, without Typescript? And still have type safety?

That's where Aquinas comes in by providing a simple API around [inversifyJS](https://inversify.io/).

Check [quickstart](./docs/quickstart) to see how it works.

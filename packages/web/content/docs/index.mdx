## The Problem

Inversion of Control (IoC) is great, really great.

Unfortunately, IoC is often tied to Object Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, which means most IoC libraries require the use of classes, decorators and reflection metadata.

This leads to some headaches, not to mention the fact that you'll have to use decorators and classes only because of IoC, while the rest of your codebase is all on callbacks and consts.

But what if we could just ignore the use of decorators, classes and reflect-metadata?

Moreover, what if we could do it in plain Javascript, without Typescript? And still have type safety?

That's where Aquinas comes in by providing a simple API around [owja/ioc](https://github.com/owja/ioc).

Check [quickstart](./docs/quickstart) to see how it works.

## Can I use Aquinas with classes?

No, check [inversifyJS](https://inversify.io/) for that.

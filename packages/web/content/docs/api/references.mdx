## References

When using Aquinas, your domain becomes composed of references.

Internally, references are actually instances of `Reference`, which is a class that holds a symbol and a type.

## Use

You can create a reference using the `reference` function:

```ts
import { reference } from "aquinas";

type UserService = {
    getUser(id: string): Promise<User>;
};

const UserServiceReference = reference<UserService>("UserService");
```

To use your reference, check next section on injectables.
